        <h3>The first bipedal robot to hit the commercial market, the Walker can be activated either by voice or by its touchscreen and serves as a robotic butler. This automated household helper can control your smart home, play music and dance, help schedule your calendar, patrol the home, and provide visual surveillance and motion detection. Although the Walker is currently armless, robotic arms that will further expand its usefulness are in development.

        <h3>Frequent fliers among us will look on with envy at the hassle-saving potential of the CX-1. In essence it’s a smart suitcase, packed full of features to take the effort out of carrying baggage. Powered wheels allow it to follow its owner autonomously, assisted by facial recognition so it can independently track users and sensors to detect and evade obstacles. There’s even an anti-theft system in place where an alarm goes off on the user’s smart wristband if the CX-1 goes beyond a certain distance.</h3>
