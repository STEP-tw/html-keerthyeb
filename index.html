        The first bipedal robot to hit the commercial market, the Walker can be
        activated either by voice or by its touchscreen and serves as a robotic
        butler.This automated household helper can control your smart home, play
        music and dance, help schedule your calendar, patrol the home, and
        provide visual surveillance and motion detection. Although the Walker is
        currently armless, robotic arms that will further expand its usefulness
        are in development.

        Frequent fliers among us will look on with envy at the hassle-saving
        potential of the CX-1. In essence it’s a smart suitcase,packed full of
        features to take the effort out of carrying baggage. Powered wheels
        allow it to follow its owner autonomously, assisted by facial
        recognition so it can independently track users and sensors to detect
        and evade obstacles. There’s even an anti-theft system in place where an
        alarm goes off on the user’s smart wristband if the CX-1 goes beyond a
        certain distance.

        The body pillow gets a robotic upgrade with the Somnox sleep robot. This
        robotics device copies the feeling of sleeping next to another person by
        mimicking respiratory function to comfort the insomniacs amongst us. The
        idea is that the Somnox helps calm anxious sleepers by giving them a
        breathing pattern to mimic that helps them fall asleep faster. While the
        idea of clasping a “breathing” robot might be unsettling to some, the
        Somnox has already proven popular.

        <h2>4. Boston Dynamics SpotMini</h2>

      <p style="font-size:20px">
        Boston Dynamics aren’t known for deploying charm offensives. Much-viewed
        videos of their dog-like robots running and jumping have thrilled and
        terrified viewers in equal measure. Perhaps the most infamous, and
        impressive, of all is the SpotMini. It’s able to run, jump, and even
        open doors. A video published earlier this year saw it carrying out
        tasks even in the face of mild human interference. Whether you feel it’s
        a harbinger of the Skynet-style technological dystopia that’s awaiting
        us or not, there’s no denying the potential applications of the
        technology are mind-boggling.

        Magic mirrors that talk back to you look like they won’t just be a
        feature of fairy tales anymore. The Care OS mirror uses gesture controls
        and facial recognition to give skincare advice, as well as playing music
        and taking selfies. It’s similar to other smartphone apps in development
        that use the camera to analyse users’ dermatological health and provide
        advice about hydration and UV exposure, albeit on a much larger,
        domestic scale.
