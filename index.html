          The first bipedal robot to hit the commercial market, the Walker can be
          activated either by voice or by its touchscreen and serves as a robotic
          butler.This automated household helper can control your smart home, play
          music and dance, help schedule your calendar, patrol the home, and
          provide visual surveillance and motion detection. Although the Walker is
          currently armless, robotic arms that will further expand its usefulness
          are in development.

      <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41CPlyeTg8Q">2. ForwardX CX-1 Robotics Suitcase</a></h2>

          Frequent fliers among us will look on with envy at the hassle-saving
          potential of the CX-1. In essence it’s a smart suitcase,packed full of
          features to take the effort out of carrying baggage. Powered wheels
          allow it to follow its owner autonomously, assisted by facial
          recognition so it can independently track users and sensors to detect
          and evade obstacles. There’s even an anti-theft system in place where an
          alarm goes off on the user’s smart wristband if the CX-1 goes beyond a
          certain distance.

      <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0WSQU92VyQ">3. Somnox Sleep Robot</a></h2>
      <img class="image-size" src="https://3sr05l2l7ihe1u4u613nqp53-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/robotic-inventions-12.jpg" />

          The body pillow gets a robotic upgrade with the Somnox sleep robot. This
          robotics device copies the feeling of sleeping next to another person by
          mimicking respiratory function to comfort the insomniacs amongst us. The
          idea is that the Somnox helps calm anxious sleepers by giving them a
          breathing pattern to mimic that helps them fall asleep faster. While the
          idea of clasping a “breathing” robot might be unsettling to some, the
          Somnox has already proven popular.

      <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7IEVTDjng">4. Boston Dynamics SpotMini</a></h2>
      <img class="image-size" src="https://3sr05l2l7ihe1u4u613nqp53-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/robotic-inventions-3.jpg" />

      <div class="div-text-style">
        <p>
          Boston Dynamics aren’t known for deploying charm offensives. Much-viewed
          videos of their dog-like robots running and jumping have thrilled and
          terrified viewers in equal measure. Perhaps the most infamous, and
          impressive, of all is the SpotMini. It’s able to run, jump, and even
          open doors. A video published earlier this year saw it carrying out
          tasks even in the face of mild human interference. Whether you feel it’s
          a harbinger of the Skynet-style technological dystopia that’s awaiting
          us or not, there’s no denying the potential applications of the
          technology are mind-boggling.

      <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMN29i59AOA">5. Care OS Smart Mirror</a></h2>
      <img class="image-size" src="https://3sr05l2l7ihe1u4u613nqp53-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/robotic-inventions-5.jpg" />

      <div class="div-text-style">
        <p>
          Magic mirrors that talk back to you look like they won’t just be a
          feature of fairy tales anymore. The Care OS mirror uses gesture controls
          and facial recognition to give skincare advice, as well as playing music
          and taking selfies. It’s similar to other smartphone apps in development
          that use the camera to analyse users’ dermatological health and provide
          advice about hydration and UV exposure, albeit on a much larger,
          domestic scale.
