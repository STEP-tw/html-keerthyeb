    <hr />
    <p>Robotics engineering has come a long way in 2018. Although the year’s not finished, we’ve already seen some exciting
      examples of what the future possibilities of robotics will look like. The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) expo
      in Las Vegas has traditionally been a major showcase for robotics breakthroughs, and January’s event certainly lived up
      to expectations. Throughout the year, some trends have been emerging that provide insight to the direction in which
      robotics development is heading, including:
    </p>

    <ul style="font-size: 20px">
      <li>Domestic cleaning robots.</li>
      <li>Companion robots.</li>
      <li>Self-driving cars.</li>
      <li>AI-powered health and wellbeing technology.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Let’s look at 5 of the most influential robotics inventions to have been unveiled thus far in 2018, that can help put
      together a picture of where the future of the industry lies.</p>

        <h2><a href=" https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/9/16869120/ubtech-walker-biped-butler-robot-ces-2018">1. Ubtech Robotics Walker</a> </h2>

        <div class="div-text-style">
          <p>
            The first bipedal robot to hit the commercial market, the Walker can be
            activated either by voice or by its touchscreen and serves as a robotic
            butler.This automated household helper can control your smart home, play
            music and dance, help schedule your calendar, patrol the home, and
            provide visual surveillance and motion detection. Although the Walker is
            currently armless, robotic arms that will further expand its usefulness
            are in development.

        <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41CPlyeTg8Q">2. ForwardX CX-1 Robotics Suitcase</a></h2>
        <img class="image-size" src="https://3sr05l2l7ihe1u4u613nqp53-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/robotic-inventions-11.jpg" />

        <div class="div-text-style">
          <p>
            Frequent fliers among us will look on with envy at the hassle-saving
            potential of the CX-1. In essence it’s a smart suitcase,packed full of
            features to take the effort out of carrying baggage. Powered wheels
            allow it to follow its owner autonomously, assisted by facial
            recognition so it can independently track users and sensors to detect
            and evade obstacles. There’s even an anti-theft system in place where an
            alarm goes off on the user’s smart wristband if the CX-1 goes beyond a
            certain distance.

        <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0WSQU92VyQ">3. Somnox Sleep Robot</a></h2>
        <img class="image-size" src="https://3sr05l2l7ihe1u4u613nqp53-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/robotic-inventions-12.jpg" />

        <div class="div-text-style">
          <p>
            The body pillow gets a robotic upgrade with the Somnox sleep robot. This
            robotics device copies the feeling of sleeping next to another person by
            mimicking respiratory function to comfort the insomniacs amongst us. The
            idea is that the Somnox helps calm anxious sleepers by giving them a
            breathing pattern to mimic that helps them fall asleep faster. While the
            idea of clasping a “breathing” robot might be unsettling to some, the
            Somnox has already proven popular.

        <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7IEVTDjng">4. Boston Dynamics SpotMini</a></h2>
        <img class="image-size" src="https://3sr05l2l7ihe1u4u613nqp53-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/robotic-inventions-3.jpg" />

        <div class="div-text-style">
          <p>
            Boston Dynamics aren’t known for deploying charm offensives. Much-viewed
            videos of their dog-like robots running and jumping have thrilled and
            terrified viewers in equal measure. Perhaps the most infamous, and
            impressive, of all is the SpotMini. It’s able to run, jump, and even
            open doors. A video published earlier this year saw it carrying out
            tasks even in the face of mild human interference. Whether you feel it’s
            a harbinger of the Skynet-style technological dystopia that’s awaiting
            us or not, there’s no denying the potential applications of the
            technology are mind-boggling.

        <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMN29i59AOA">5. Care OS Smart Mirror</a></h2>
        <img class="image-size" src="https://3sr05l2l7ihe1u4u613nqp53-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/robotic-inventions-5.jpg" />

        <div class="div-text-style">
          <p>
            Magic mirrors that talk back to you look like they won’t just be a
            feature of fairy tales anymore. The Care OS mirror uses gesture controls
            and facial recognition to give skincare advice, as well as playing music
            and taking selfies. It’s similar to other smartphone apps in development
            that use the camera to analyse users’ dermatological health and provide
            advice about hydration and UV exposure, albeit on a much larger,
            domestic scale.
